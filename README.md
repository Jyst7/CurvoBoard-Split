# CurvoBoard-Split

My idea for this was to try and make one of those fancy looking ergonomic keyboards with a pcb. I have seen some other designs just have each individual key have a separate housing for the shifting on each row of keys but i want to just make a few pcbs and connect them so this will be ortholinear with a curve in the board vertically and a thumb cluster. I designed a corne keyboard recently but the issue was I felt I did not have enough keys for what I wanted to do so here i have 5 rows of 7 keys and a thumb cluster with 5 keys meaning 40 keys per half of the board or 80 total.
